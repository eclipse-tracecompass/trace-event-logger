Process traces like so:
$ ../../../jsonify.py trace.log cache_trace.json

Then open "cache_trace.json" in Trace Compass. Select trace type:
"Trace Event Format" -> "Generic Trace Event Trace"

If this trace type is not available, you may need to install support
for it:
Help -> Install New Software, then search for "trace event". Under 
category "Trace Types", install:
"Trace Compass TraceEvent Parser (incubator)"
